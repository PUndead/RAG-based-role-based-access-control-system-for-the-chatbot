## 🔐 Key Features

- **Strict Role-Based Access**: Fine-grained access to content by department (Finance, HR, Engineering, Marketing, C-Level, Employee).
- **RAG-Powered Responses**: Combines semantic search with large language models for accurate, source-grounded replies.
- **Custom Document Ingestion**: Supports both Markdown and CSV formats.
- **Persistent Vector Store**: Efficient and fast retrieval using ChromaDB.
- **Multi-Model Support**: Easily configurable with OpenRouter, DeepSeek, Mistral, and others.
- **Intuitive UI**: Clean, web-based frontend built with Streamlit.
